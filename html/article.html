                    <p>The world may seem like a big place, but we can't really go very far. For us, it is just a small corner. We eat, sleep and work in the same way in this cramped space, day in and day out.</p>
                    <p>We are depressed, miserable, anxious and restless. We long for freedom, but freedom itself is only an illusion. Fortunately, there is a window called "light and shadow" in this space, and the view from it is beautiful. Through this window, we can see the stars above and the light below. We can see the sun and the moon together and the prosperity of the world.</p>
                    <p>In the 24 frames of light and shadow, thousands of lives are lived with optimism and pessimism. They embrace love and hate, feel joy and sorrow, experience life and death. They carry their ideals, they search for existence, they fight for their love, they are legends.</p>
                    <p>When you've seen a thousand different lives, you've seen heaven and earth and felt all beings. The 1,001th possibility of living that life is to see yourself again after having seen heaven and earth and all beings.</p>
                    <p>Yes, when we are anxious, confused and underestimated, a good film can bring us relax, enlighten and inspire or follow the characters in a film and experience a different kind of life that we have never known before.</p>
                    <p>If you are at a low point and have a lot of things weighing on your mind that you can't get rid of, why not stop living? Why not stop your step and watch a film? Hopefully, for a moment, it will save you from your depression.</p>

                    <p>Looking back on the past few years, the biggest change is that the fervour for film or movie has gradually been tempered, and more enthusiasm has been thrown into the scenes of life, and as a result, we have come to appreciate those moments that are often overlooked but precious. We have always misunderstood ourselves, mistaking a momentary impulse for an enduring passion, when the raw power of fascination is often found in the routine of life.</p>
                    <p>In the past two years, I have travelled from place to place, examining my old life with fresh experiences, my thoughts and horizons have widened a little in the unknown frontier, and when I sit in front the movie again, my viewing perception is completely overturned and rebuilt, but I find myself enjoying the process more than ever.</p>
                    <p>The choice of the films recommended on this website is purely based on a thought, without much distinction of ranking preferences, nor do I want to tinker with them for the sake of some obsession, I prefer to believe that the most genuine choice is the one that is made without thinking.</p>

                    <p>A good movie gives you a wider perspective and makes you think more, rather than simply pursuing visual stimulation. The meaning of a film is like the meaning of life, the meaning of life is in life itself, the meaning of a film is in the film itself. Sometimes the philosophy in movie is more interesting than books, also more understandable than life.</p>
                    <p>Film has prolonged our life by almost three times, it has taught us many things that we would never have understood in a lifetime. Review our life from a different perspective, accept the reality that you are ultimately ordinary, but never give up the pursuit of your ideals, to be kind-hearted, love our life and enjoy the moment. Perhaps if you understand this, you will understand the true meaning of life.</p>

                    <p><strong>In the hundred years since its inception, cinema has gone from being a novel form of entertainment to an all-encompassing seventh art.</strong></p>
                    <p>The six traditional classical arts are architecture, painting, sculpture, music, dance and poetry. Of these, architecture and music are considered to be the main forms of art, painting and sculpture complement architecture, while dance and poetry are integrated into music.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally theatre/drama was known as the eighth art, while games are now known as the ninth art.</p>
                    <p>But film has the distinction of encompassing all other forms of artistic expression, resulting in an integrated viewing experience.</p>
                    <p>It can tell a story, it can also highlight forms like poetry, the rhythm of music and the form of architecture, he can also take theatre with him, and it can also extend the experience of 3D, 4D, 5D, VR and so on for games.</p>
                    <p><strong>All in all, film is about two things: the content and the situation.</strong></p>
                    <div class="image-benefit"><img src="../Image/reading.png" alt="reading"></div>
                    <p>Content is something based on text, just like reading a book, a novel of several hundred thousand words can be condensed into a two-hour film.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, an excellent film can be unfolded into a book of several hundred thousand words already.</p>
                    <p>A person who loves to read can recline on the sofa at any time of the day, listening to music and reading a book with great pleasure.</p>
                    <p>And the combined experience that can be gained from a proper film is much more complex than reading a book.</p>
                    <p>Because it is a constant flow of musical images, it must be an hour or more long to maintain a high level of concentration and is a great test of reading ability.</p>
                    <p>Countless times I have seen people eating popcorn and drinking soft drinks in the cinema and chatting about it, then jumping up when the lights come on and saying "shit" and leaving. They didn't even watch the movie, they just went to the cinema to have a chat. If you want them to watch a movie seriously, it's not possible anymore. These people have lost their basic reading skills and can't even finish a few hundred words, so how can you expect them to keep their attention for two hours?</p>
                    <p><strong>Add a bit more formality to the mix and it's even more confusing.</strong></p>
                    <p>If you go to the cinema with a world-class master score, you will only feel your eardrums being shaken, and the rhythm and melody will not match the story, so you will not have time to enjoy the picturesque beauty of the shots.</p>

                        <p>The colour palette, the layers of light and shadow, the composition, the camera movement, the architecture, the interiors, the costume design, the acting, the meaning of the lines, they are invisible.</p>
                        <p>A good film is a mirror, your mind are deep and he is deep, your mind are light and he is light. The vast majority of good films are difficult to appreciate in their entirety after only one viewing.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays, there is a clear polarisation between the two types of film viewing: many people watch a film many times over, and it has become the norm to watch it twice or three times. And some of them can't understand anything and can only curse the director on the internet for not being able to make a film.</p>
                        <p><strong>There is a very strange comment that watching a film is about watching a story, and not being too complicated.</strong></p>
                        <p>Film was never meant to be a storytelling tool, otherwise why not just read a book at home. What is the logic of criticising a film for being too profound because you are superficial and ignorant?</p>
                        <p><strong>Creation is always subjective, and any art form is an expression of the author's thoughts, while film is probably the most "objective" art form.</strong></p>
                        <p>The script, shooting, acting, music, editing, special effects and compositing are all done by different people, and it's quite a team, with the director and producer doing a lot of the management work. For commercial films in particular, the director is a labourer and does not have all the decisions.</p>
                        <p>In fact a great deal of films are biased towards content, and if the director packages and hides his sense of ideas, it makes the whole film more difficult to understand.</p>
                        <p><strong>If you want to see films with content, you necessarily have to expand your reading.</strong></p>
                        <p>Some Hollywood films, because they are industrial products, have been made in such a way that the form is so extreme that the content is instead weakened and there is not much to think about. But it is not for everyone, either. The test is the comprehensive training in the classical arts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Going formal, is also art.</strong></p>
                        <p>Only by insisting on improving one's reading and striving to enhance one's appreciation of various arts can one first ensure that one understands the content of the film before it becomes an effective form of entertainment. It is only after watching the film that something can be gained.</p>
