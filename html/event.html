            <div id="title-explain">WHAT IS FILM TO US?</div>
            <div class="content">The word film is commonly and unfamiliarly understood by the general public. Many people think that a film is just a two-hour drama with a flashy plot and visuals that are mostly filled with special effects and super expensive productions to manipulate the viewer's emotions. However, this is not the case.</div>
            <div class="content">Films can be based on great storylines or remakes of real-life cases. Often, a series of social stories and moral values are reflected behind the scenes, and bring the darker side of our society is brought to the public's attention, and the reality of society is examined together.</div>
            <div class="content">Of course, the social stories brought out in the films may also subconsciously influence the minds of the viewers. The storylines in the films are both beautiful and cruel, but there is no denying that there is some meaning behind the stories. Changing the universal values of the viewer is perhaps the meaning and value of a film.</div>

                        <p>A major event, the Film Day, was held on campus.</p>
                        <p>Several excellent movies were provided for teachers and students on the day, and five lecture classrooms were rented for the screening of the films, with 350 people attending. The event lasted for 6 hours and 10 films were shown, including "The Redemption of Schenker", "LEON" and else.</p>
                        <p>The feedback from the event was unanimously positive, but due to the pandemic it was not possible to hold any major gatherings. We hope to bring the festival back to APU campus life again in the near future.</p>

                        <p>The aim of the event is to attract more students or teachers who are interested in film and short movie and to provide a way of making short films and knowledge.
