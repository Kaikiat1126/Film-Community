                        <div class="community-content">The film has just been released in Taiwan, but the translation of the subtitles has accidentally led to a firestorm and a debate. The controversy caused by the translation has forced the film's distributor to apologise.</div>
                        <div class="community-content">Many people felt that the film was superb but the translation was a mess, but the translator stressed that "there is no right or wrong translation, only whether the boss likes it or not" and that "my own translation is good".</div>
                        <div class="community-content">But this attitude seems to have upset many people who were looking forward to the film and even said they would refuse to see it in cinemas.</div>
